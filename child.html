<div class="md-padding">
    <h2>Hello from Child Component: {{child.name}}!</h2>
    <p>
        The child component uses one-way binding with its parent object.  
        So as child changes the {name}, the parent component will keep its
        own version.
    </p>
    <p>
        The child component also "requires" the parent controller via the '^parent'
        property, and can then call functions on the parent directly.  In this case the 
        refresh() function is called when the child {name} field is changed.
    </p>
    <label>Name(child):</label>
    <input type="text" ng-model="child.name" ng-blur="child.change()" placeholder="Enter child name here">
